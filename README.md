# Redoc CityBikes API Documentation

This API documentation explains how to use the CityBikes API for developers. 


It leverages Redoc to enhance the 
[existing documentation](https://api.citybik.es/v2/) by elaborating 
on all avaliable endpoints, requests and responses, schemas,
error codes, authentication requirements, and examples.

is an open-source project providing information about global 
bike-sharing transportation services.
